[name] Longer Assimilation
[works for] early early1139 high
[description] The process of conquering provinces is a lot harder with this script.\n\n
During the first turns a conquered settlement will have additional 10-25% turmoil and lower religion conversion rates. Your forces will have to stay longer inside a settlement, giving the enemy time to regroup forces and counter-attack.\n\n
Additionally, the player cannot build/repair/retrain/recruit in a settlement in the first turn of the conquered - which reflects the actual time to establish new administration in a conquered province.
