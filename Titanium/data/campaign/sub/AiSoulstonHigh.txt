[description] Soulston's campaign AI improvements\n
Based on Savage AI\n
AI needs poor relations to invade if not neighbour\n
Pope Won't invade rebels\n
Trusted Allies help more\n
Alliances now work differently:\n
- Catholics wont want to ally with anyone besides Catholics\n
- Islam works the same way\n
- Orthodox factions can ally with pagans.\n\n
Aggressiveness - 6/10\n
Backstabs - 7/10\n
Ally holding - 6/10\n
Alternative balanced AI.
