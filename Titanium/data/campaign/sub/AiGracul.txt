[description] Gracul's AI, known for its aggressive style and constant backstabs when your faction is weak. You can actually lose to the AI!\n
The play-style of the computer resembles my own - expand and kill the weak even if it's your ally.\n
The computer will also create a lot of alliance blocks, and the world is at constant TOTAL WAR!\n
Ally holding only works if your actually a lot stronger than your allies.\n\n
Summary:\n
Aggressiveness - 10/10\n
Backstabs - 10/10\n
Ally holding - 2/10\n
Constant war state.
