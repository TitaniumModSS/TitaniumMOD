[description] This addition helps represent the 'house rules' some of the SS people like to play with.\n\n
With this script, a player can only build/recruit etc. if there is a governor present in the settlement. Without a governor, the player can only switch on the auto-management, which is of course not perfect.\n
A governor has to be present inside the settlement only to issue orders, so it's still possible to march with a general inside the settlement, adjust your queues, and then leave the settlement. Be aware that you won't even be able to stop a building construction without a governor.
