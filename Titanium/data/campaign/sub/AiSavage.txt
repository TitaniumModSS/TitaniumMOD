[description] Savage AI is the one enjoyed by most of the people at the SS forums.\n
The AI is more aggressive than Lusted AI, but not very backstabbing (though more so than Lusted's) and the computer doesn't like to fight multiple factions at the same time.\n
It's easy to get some alliances early on, many of which will probably hold for the rest of the game.\n
Still, backstabs can happen, however, the AI will not go into a war frenzy.\n\n
Aggressive - 5/10\n
Backstabbing - 4/10\n
Trustworthy - 5/10\n
Good balance between peace and war.
